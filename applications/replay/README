---------------------- Install -----------------------------
	- Type 'make' to build tsh2eth converter
	- Type make install to install the files

Additional packages you may need
	- tcpreplay
	- uml-utilities (for the tunctl program)
	- tshark [tethereal] (for converting erf trace formats)

----------------------- Usage ------------------------------

$ replayer.sh top_trace_dir

-------------------- Information ---------------------------

This script simply replays a trace file collection. 
There are two things that should be taken in mind.


Directory hierarchy.

eg. traces---nlanr---PMA
           |       |-MEM
           |       \-SDA
		   |
		   \-momo---point1
		          \-point2

the script will traverse through the directories but the only 
directories that can have traces to be replayed are the leaves
(in the example: PMA, MEM, SDA, point1 and point2).


Directory and file options.

As a leaf directory is processed, the script makes the following
checks: whether a tun/tap interface with the directory's name exists
and whether mapi.conf contains an entry for this interface
So, in case of a new directory with trace files a tun device with
its name is created and an entry to the mapi.conf file is added.
The next step is the trace file preperation. Here, files are 
converted to pcap format depending on their suffixes.
eg. for file trace1.tsh.bz2 the script will first bunzip the file
and then convert the tsh format to pcap.
Corrently two zip formats are supported: bz2 and gz. And two trace
file formats: tsh and erf. But more types can be added easily.

Special files

.desc			if present, it contains the descriptions for the 
				interface to be added in the mapi.conf file. This 
				file can only contain one line.

.replay-log		contains the output of tcpreplay. Useful if a
				tracefile cannot be replayed for any reason.

.replay-pid		contains the process id of the tcpreplay associated
				with each leaf directory. Used to check whether 
				a replay session is still alive.

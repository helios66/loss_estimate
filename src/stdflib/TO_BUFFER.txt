PACKET ZERO COPY FOR NICs
- The packet is copied in TO_BUFFER.
- offline flows use the same cbuf!
- Zero-copy cannot be performed since pcap performs at least one copy in
kernel-space and one from kernel to user-space. (Maybe we can go around this
by pointing pcap to our cbuf! This could fail major time if kernel cannot
right to user-space memory).
- The whole FIFO is writable, but we do safe_write in mapid.

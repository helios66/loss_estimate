This package provides a library to parse the subset of Berkeley Packet Filter
(BPF) expression language into the target independent node tree. Parser is
based on the libpcap library source.

Also some output routines are provided either:

   1) to create a filter for COMBO6 network adaptors,

   2) to create a XML configuration for Endace DAG network capturing cards using
      the DSM filtering.

For more details see the manpage bpf2dagdsm.1 and script test_bpf2dagdsm for
example usage.

This directory contains the sources of a MAPI library with one
function, named RULER. The RULER function takes a single parameter,
the name of a filter for the Ruler packet rewriting compiler. This
filter is compiled upon initialisation of the function, and all
packets in a flow are then applied to the compiled Ruler filter.

For more information about Ruler, see
